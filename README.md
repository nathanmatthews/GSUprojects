# GSUprojects
Final projects for classes at gsu

The gOODexe project was build using winforms and I part of the team project was creating the concessions calculator. Unfortunately I don't have to full projct anymore cause in college i didn't know how to use github so all i uploaded was the .exe file but you can see how the concessions section runs.
